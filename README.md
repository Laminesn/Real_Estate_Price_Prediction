Regression Techniques for Real Estate Price Prediction

- Implemented Ridge Regression: Developed a Ridge Regression class using NumPy, incorporating methods for fitting the model and making predictions. This enhances robustness against multicollinearity in the dataset.

- Data Preprocessing: Processed real estate data by cleaning, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing features. This involved removing irrelevant columns, handling missing values, and applying one-hot encoding and standard scaling to improve model performance and convergence.

- Model Evaluation: Trained and evaluated Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Ridge Regression, and Polynomial Regression models. The Polynomial degree 3 Ridge Regression achieved the best performance with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 74,018 on the validation set, indicating superior generalization to new data.
